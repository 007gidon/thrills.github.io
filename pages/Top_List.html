            The Scream franchise quickly climbed the ranks to become one of the best scary movie series of all time,
            with director Wes Craven creating a meta slasher/murder mystery that enthralled, entertained, and scared the
            living daylights out of people. With 4 mainline entries from the master of horror, Ghostface and the Scream
            horror franchise as a whole became one of the top horror franchises thanks to its ability to keep things
            fresh and fun. With Wes's tragic passing, many believed the series would be finished, but the team at Radio
            Silence have continued the franchise and paid a beautiful tribute to the man who created it. With six films
            in two and a half decades and no signs of slowing down, Scream is quickly becoming a staple and classic
            horror franchise.

            With only three films released over a decade-long span, one would be forgiven to question the validity of
            The Conjuring franchise as one of the best scary movie series of all time, however, this incredibly
            impactful and revolutionary mainstream horror franchise has more than earned its flowers atop the horror
            dynasty. Arguably one of the most successful horror movie franchises of the last 30 years, The Conjuring
            redefined what horror was throughout the decade, as its uber popularity led to many films attempting, and
            failing, to recreate the magic the films had. Utterly frightening ghost stories with heart as well as
            chills, The Conjuring franchise is one of the best modern horror movie series and a masterclass in terror.

            Splatter and “torture-porn” became a staple in the horror genre thanks to one film series that changed what
            many perceived mainstream horror to be, and that is without a doubt the Saw franchise. With 10 films
            released over the last two decades and another already scheduled to be on the way, Saw quickly become one of
            the most important scary movie series to watch thanks to its risque subject matter, brazen attitude towards
            filmmaking, and utterly shocking and vile scenes of violence. While the story could be boiled down to soap
            opera levels of absurdity, the core of the film was always the terrifying and horrifying traps, each more
            intense, masochistic, and gruesome than the last. Quickly becoming one of the most successful horror movie
            franchises of all time, Saw is a staple for hardcore horror fans.

            With 9 films, 4 different timelines, and one of the most beloved and adored killers in the history of horror
            cinema, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise is one of the most interesting and bizarre in horror history.
            With each film having a drastically different tone than the last,l horror, comedy, absurdity, and utter
            terror fill the respective 8 films and showcase the highest highs and lowest lows these horror franchises
            have to offer. While Leatherface remains a staple, cannibalism runs rampant, and kills are galore, the story
            fluctuates so rapidly in the films that it can be difficult for the casual horror fan to follow. Regardless,
            however, there is no doubt that the original film that started it all will go down in history as arguably
            the greatest horror film ever made.

            Halloween is without a doubt one of the strangest popular horror franchises ever released. While the first
            film in the series is arguably one of the best the genre has ever produced, its subsequent 12 sequels all
            become increasingly weird and wacky. With 5 different timelines, films that contradict one another, a reboot
            series, a standalone spinoff, and one of the most beloved killers in horror history, Michael Myers has been
            busy meeting the minds and scaring the bejesus out of horror fans for nearly 50 years, and he has no sights
            on slowing down anytime soon. Without a doubt one of the biggest horror franchises of all time and one of
            the scariest movie series to ever grace the silver screen, it doesn't matter how weird or bizarre this
            franchise becomes, horror fans big and small will always come back to this esteemed and beloved horror movie
            series.

            When the Insidious franchise was first released in 2010, it ushered in a new era of terrific and terrifying
            horror films. Gone were the obscene and grotesque splatter films, in were the paranormal mysteries and
            mystifying jump scares. Insidious more than helped set the tone for the decade in horror, and its subsequent
            three sequels over the next 8 years solidified the brand as the next best scary movie series. While the
            franchise has been on hiatus over the last 5 years, 2023 is offering a brand new experience into the Further
            with Insidious: The Dark Realm, taking the franchise back to its origins and hoping to reignite the
            paranormal fire it sparked back in 2010

            Freddy Kruger ushered in a new age of terror throughout the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and created
            one of the scariest movie series and most beloved horror figures of all time. A killer who hunts down teens
            in their dreams, this bone-chilling premise was executed to perfection throughout its initial 7 film run and
            subsequent reboot, and the franchise as a whole remains one of the best scary movie series to watch. Utterly
            terrifying, frightfully fun, and wickedly entertaining, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic horror
            franchise for a reason, it helped define the genre as we know it and produced some of the best horror films
            of all time.

            With 12 mainline film entries, the Friday the 13th franchise helped usher in the slasher subgenre of the 80s
            and 90s, and introduced the world to one of the most beloved and adored killers in all of horror, Jason
            Voorhees. One of the most successful horror movie franchises of all time and without a doubt one of the
            scariest movie series of all time, Friday the 13 influenced, inspired, and astonished generation after
            generation of horror fans. While subsequent installments in the franchise would become wackier and more
            ludicrous, looking at you Jason X, there is no doubt about the amount of fun, joy, and terror this beloved
            horror franchise brings to its community.

            The Child's Play, or Chucky franchise as it has grown to be known as, is without a doubt one of the
            strangest, wackiest, and most incredible horror movie series of all time. With each film leaning heavier and
            heavier into the lunacy of having a killer doll tormenting children, committing brutal murders, and making
            some of the best jokes of the genre, there have been 7 mainline movies, a reboot, and even a television
            series over the nearly 35 years since the masochistic killer doll first gave horror audiences their first
            scare. While the series is by no means high-brow or intellectual, the Child's Play franchise is without a
            doubt one of the best scary movie series of all time.

            Inarguably one of the best science fiction and horror blends of all time, the Alien franchise has been a
            shocking, revolutionary, and utterly important scary movie series to watch for all fans of the genre. The
            titular alien in the franchise is one of the most beloved, iconic, and memorable creatures created in the
            history of cinema, and with more beloved scenes than one can count, the franchise has left a resounding
            impact on the minds, hearts, and souls of millions around the globe. Sigourney Weaver helped create one of
            the most powerful and revolutionary female leads in history with Ellen Ripley, and while the horror movie
            series may have become incredibly convoluted over the last 4 decades, the first two films will be remembered
            for all time as being utter classics in the horror genre.
