            <h1 id="wassup">The Shining</h1>
            The Shining is a 1980 horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist
            Diane Johnson. It is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name and stars Jack Nicholson, Danny
            Lloyd, Shelley Duvall, and Scatman Crothers. Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer and recovering
            alcoholic who accepts a new position as the off-season caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. Lloyd plays his
            young son Danny, who has psychic abilities ("the shining"), which he learns about from head chef Dick
            Hallorann (Crothers). Danny's imaginary friend Tony warns him the hotel is haunted before a winter storm
            leaves the family snowbound in the Colorado Rockies. Jack's sanity deteriorates under the influence of the
            hotel and the residents, and Danny and his mother Wendy (Duvall) face mortal danger.

            The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October 2 by Warner
            Bros. There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the preceding
            cut; about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen
            King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. The film received two controversial
            nominations at the first Razzies in 1981—Worst Director and Worst Actress—the latter of which was later
            rescinded in 2022 due to Kubrick's treatment of Duvall on set. Critical response to the film has since
            become favorable.
