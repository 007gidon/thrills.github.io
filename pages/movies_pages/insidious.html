            Insidious is a 2010 supernatural horror film directed and co-edited by James Wan, written by Leigh Whannell,
            and starring Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Barbara Hershey. It is the first installment in the Insidious
            franchise and the third in terms of the series' in-story chronology. The story centers on a married couple
            whose boy inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for a variety of demonic entities in an
            astral plane.

            Insidious had its world premiere on September 14, 2010, at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival
            (TIFF) and received a wide theatrical release on April 1, 2011, by FilmDistrict. The film is followed by two
            sequels, Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013), Insidious: The Red Door (2023); and two prequels, Insidious: Chapter 3
            (2015) and Insidious: The Last Key (2018).

                <p>"Martyrs" embodies a unique blend of two distinct horror subgenres:

                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">Supernatural Horror:</p>
                        "Insidious" delves deeply into supernatural horror, focusing on paranormal phenomena,
                        otherworldly entities, and the eerie realms beyond our understanding. The film explores the
                        concept of astral projection, where the protagonist's son falls into a mysterious coma and
                        becomes trapped in a ghostly dimension called "The Further." As the family grapples with
                        malevolent spirits and haunted houses, viewers are immersed in a world where the boundaries
                        between the living and the dead blur, creating an atmosphere of unease and terror.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">Possession Horror:</p>
                        "Insidious" also delves into possession horror, portraying characters as vessels for malevolent
                        entities. The film centers on the protagonist's son, Dalton, who becomes the target of a
                        powerful demon seeking to possess him. As the entity's influence intensifies, Dalton's behavior
                        becomes increasingly erratic, leading to terrifying encounters with the supernatural. Through
                        its exploration of possession, "Insidious" taps into primal fears of losing control and being
                        manipulated by dark forces beyond comprehension.
