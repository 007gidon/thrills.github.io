            <h1 id="wassup">Last Night In Soho</h1>
            Last Night in Soho is a 2021 British psychological horror film directed by Edgar Wright and co-written by
            Wright and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. It stars Thomasin McKenzie as a naive teenager who moves to London to study
            fashion design; there she is haunted by visions of Sandie (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), a glamorous young
            woman who had lived during the Swinging Sixties. The cast also features Matt Smith, Rita Tushingham, Michael
            Ajao, Terence Stamp and Diana Rigg. It marks the final film appearances of Rigg and Margaret Nolan, who both
            died in 2020, and is dedicated to their memories.

            Following its premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on 4 September 2021, Last Night in
            Soho was released theatrically in the UK and the US on 29 October 2021 by Universal Pictures and Focus
            Features, respectively. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its technical
            aspects, direction and performances, while its writing received some criticism (especially the ending). The
            film grossed $23 million worldwide on a budget of $43 million, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was
            still suppressing box office revenues. The film was nominated for two BAFTA Film Awards, including
            Outstanding British Film and Best Sound.
