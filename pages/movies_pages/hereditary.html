            <h1 id="wassup">Hereditary</h1>
            Hereditary is a 2018 American psychological supernatural horror film written and directed by Ari Aster in
            his feature directorial debut. Starring Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, Ann Dowd, and Gabriel
            Byrne, the film follows a grieving family tormented by a demonic entity after the death of their secretive
            grandmother.

            Aster's work on short horror films, most notably The Strange Thing About the Johnsons, attracted the
            attention of A24, who greenlit Hereditary as his first feature film. Aster conceived it as primarily a
            family drama consisting of two distinct halves. Filming took place in Utah in 2017, with most indoor scenes
            shot on custom built sets on a soundstage to give the film a dollhouse aesthetic.

            Hereditary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018, and was theatrically released in
            the United States on June 8, 2018. The film received widespread acclaim, with particular praise for the
            performances, Aster's direction, and Stetson's score. It made over $82 million on a $10 million budget,
            becoming A24's highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record that was held until the release of
            Everything Everywhere All at Once in 2022.
