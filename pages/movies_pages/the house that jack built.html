            The House That Jack Built is a 2018 psychological horror art film written and directed by Lars von Trier. It
            stars Matt Dillon, Bruno Ganz, Uma Thurman, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Sofie Gråbøl, Riley Keough, and Jeremy
            Davies. Its plot follows Jack (Dillon), a serial killer who, over a 12-year period from the late 1970s into
            1980s, commits numerous murders in the U.S. state of Washington. Utilizing Dante's Inferno as a metatext,[5]
            the film is structured as a series of flashback vignettes relayed by Jack to the Roman poet Virgil, during
            which Jack attempts to make an argument for his crimes.

            Originally conceived as a television project by von Trier, The House That Jack Built began production in
            Sweden in 2016. The film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, marking von Trier's return to the festival
            after more than six years. The House That Jack Built received polarized reviews from critics, and criticism
            for its graphic violence.
