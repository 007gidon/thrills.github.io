            <h1 id="wassup">The Babadook</h1>
            The Babadook is a 2014 Australian psychological horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent in her
            feature directorial debut, based on her 2005 short film Monster. Starring Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel
            Henshall, Hayley McElhinney, Barbara West, and Ben Winspear, the film follows a widowed single mother who
            with her son must confront a mysterious humanoid monster in their home.

            The Babadook premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 17 January 2014 and was given a limited release in
            Australian cinemas on 22 May 2014, initially failing to become a commercial success in its native country.
            However, it generated wider attention internationally, grossing $10 million against its $2 million budget.
            The film received universal acclaim, with particular praise for the performances of the cast, creature
            design, premise, and themes. At the 4th AACTA Awards, it won for Best Film, and Kent won for Best Direction
            and Best Original Screenplay, respectively. In the years since its release, The Babadook has become a cult
            classic partly due to its popularity as an internet meme.

            The term babadook is an invention of director Jennifer Kent. It is improvised from the Serbian word for the
            boogeyman: babaroga.

                    This psychological horror film, directed by Jennifer Kent, skillfully blends supernatural horror
                    with a gripping examination of grief and the strained relationship between a mother and son. The
                    film's eerie atmosphere, haunting imagery, and psychological complexity contribute to its status as
                    a modern horror classic that transcends conventional scares to delve into the darker realms of the
                    human mind.
