            The Nun is a 2018 American gothic supernatural horror film directed by Corin Hardy and written by Gary
            Dauberman, from a story by Dauberman and James Wan. It serves as a spiritual spin-off to The Conjuring
            2 and is the fifth installment in The Conjuring shared universe. The film stars Taissa Farmiga, Demián
            Bichir and Jonas Bloquet, with Bonnie Aarons reprising her role as the Demon Nun, an incarnation of Valak,
            from The Conjuring 2. The plot follows a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her novitiate as they uncover an
            unholy secret in 1952 Romania. It is followed by a sequel The Nun II, released in 2023.

            Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema announced The Nun, a spin-off film to The Conjuring 2, which had
            opened five days earlier, with Safran and Wan producing. The initial script for the film was written by
            David Leslie Johnson. Hardy had signed on to direct The Nun with a new screenplay from Wan and Dauberman.
            Principal photography began in May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania, and during filming, the set was blessed by an
            Eastern Orthodox priest.

            The Nun was released in the United States on September 7, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Critics praised
            its performances and atmosphere, but criticized its weak narrative and inconsistent logic. It grossed $366
            million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series. In 2023, a sequel The Nun II, was
            released with Michael Chaves directing and James Wan and Peter returning as co-producers.
