            <h1 id="wassup">The Craft</h1>
            The Craft is a 1996 American teen supernatural horror film directed by Andrew Fleming from a screenplay by
            Peter Filardi and Fleming and a story by Filardi. The film stars Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell,
            and Rachel True. It follows four outcast teenage girls at a Los Angeles parochial high school who pursue
            witchcraft for their own gain and subsequently experience negative repercussions.

            The Craft was theatrically released in the United States on May 3, 1996, by Columbia Pictures. It was a
            surprise hit, earning $6.7 million in its opening weekend and $55.6 million worldwide, against a budget of
            $15 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's feminist messaging, the
            performances of the leads, direction, and production values, but criticized its writing for succumbing to
            horror film clichés.

            In the years since its release, the film has gained a cult following. The film was nominated for a
            Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Fairuza Balk for Best Supporting Actress. Balk and Tunney also won the
            MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. A sequel, The Craft: Legacy, was released on October 28, 2020.
