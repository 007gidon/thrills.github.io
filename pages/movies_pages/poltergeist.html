            Poltergeist is a 1982 American supernatural horror film directed by Tobe Hooper and written by Steven
            Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor from a story by Spielberg. It stars JoBeth Williams, Craig T.
            Nelson and Beatrice Straight, and was produced by Spielberg and Frank Marshall. The film focuses on a
            suburban family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that abduct their youngest daughter.

            As Spielberg was contractually unable to direct another film while he made E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,
            Hooper was selected based on his work on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Funhouse. The origin of
            Poltergeist can be traced to Night Skies, which Spielberg conceived as a horror sequel to his 1977 film
            Close Encounters of the Third Kind; Hooper was less interested in the sci-fi elements and suggested they
            collaborate on a ghost story. Accounts differ as to the level of Spielberg's involvement, but it is clear
            that he was frequently on set during filming and exerted significant creative control. For that reason, some
            have said that Spielberg should be considered the film's co-director or even main director, though both
            Spielberg and Hooper have disputed this.

                    The film revolves around the Freeling family, who experience a series of disturbing occurrences in
                    their home, such as objects moving on their own, mysterious voices, and encounters with malevolent
                    spirits. As the supernatural activity escalates, the family becomes increasingly terrorized by
                    forces beyond their understanding, leading to a desperate struggle for survival.
