            <h1 id="wassup">American Psycho</h1>
            American Psycho is a 2000 satirical psychological horror film directed by Mary Harron, who co-wrote the
            screenplay with Guinevere Turner. Based on the 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis, it stars Christian Bale as
            Patrick Bateman, a New York City investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer. Willem Dafoe,
            Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Chloë Sevigny, Samantha Mathis, Cara Seymour, Justin Theroux, and Reese Witherspoon
            appear in supporting roles. The film blends horror and black comedy to satirize 1980s yuppie culture and
            consumerism, exemplified by Bateman and supporting cast. Jeff Sackman is credited for the role of executive
            producer.
            American Psycho premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2000, and was theatrically released
            in the United States on April 14. The film received positive reviews, with praise for Bale's performance and
            the screenplay. Grossing over $34 million on a $7 million budget, the film was considered a box-office
            success. Following the DVD release in 2005, American Psycho quickly developed a large cult following. The
            film experienced a revival of popular interest in the 2020s due to its strong presence in contemporary meme
            culture, typically centered around Bateman's perceived "sigma male" personality. A direct-to-video
            sequel, American Psycho 2, was released in 2002, although it was criticized by Ellis who maintains it is not
            a part of the American Psycho narrative.
