            Evil Dead is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by Fede Álvarez (in his feature directorial
            debut), who co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. Dubbed a "re-imagining" of The Evil Dead (1981), the
            film is the fourth installment in the Evil Dead film series. It stars Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou
            Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore. The story follows a group of five people under attack
            by deadites in a remote cabin in the woods.

            Talks for a fourth Evil Dead film began in 2004, with original film actor Bruce Campbell about the
            possibility for a next film in the franchise. The project was officially announced in July 2011, with Ghost
            House Pictures producing it, Diablo Cody in the process of revising the script, and Fede Álvarez chosen as
            the director. Much of the cast joined from January to February 2012. Principal photography took place in
            March 2012 and wrapped in May in New Zealand outside of Auckland, lasting about a month.

            Evil Dead had its premiere at South by Southwest on March 8, 2013, and was released in the United States on
            April 5, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed
            $97 million worldwide against a production budget of $17 million. A fifth installment, titled Evil Dead
            Rise, was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on April 21, 2023.

                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">Supernatural Horror:</p>
                        Evil Dead (2013) delves deep into the supernatural subgenre, portraying demonic possession and
                        occult themes as a group of friends unwittingly summon malevolent spirits by discovering the
                        Book of the Dead in a remote cabin. The film explores the ancient evil and supernatural forces
                        at play, as characters fight for survival against demonic entities.

                        <p id="pi">Splatter+Exploitation:</p>
                        Evil Dead (2013) embraces the splatter and
                        exploitation subgenres. It features graphic and excessive gore, typical of splatter films, and
                        pushes the boundaries of horror with its intense and unrelenting depiction of violence and
                        brutality, embracing the tradition of exploitation cinema for shock value.
