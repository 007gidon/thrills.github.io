            The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan and written by Chad Hayes
            and Carey W. Hayes. It is the inaugural film in The Conjuring Universe franchise. Patrick Wilson and Vera
            Farmiga star as Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent cases
            of haunting. Their purportedly real-life reports inspired The Amityville Horror story and film franchise.
            The Warrens come to the assistance of the Perron family, who experienced increasingly disturbing events in
            their newly occupied farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971.

            Development of the film began in January 2012, and reports confirmed Wan as the director of a film entitled
            The Warren Files, later retitled The Conjuring. Production commenced in Wilmington, North Carolina, in
            February 2012, and scenes were shot in chronological order. The Conjuring was released in the United States
            and Canada on July 19, 2013, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It received positive reviews from
            critics, who praised the performances, direction, screenplay, atmosphere, and musical score. It grossed over
            $319 million worldwide against its $20 million budget. A sequel, The Conjuring 2, was released in 2016.
