            <h1 id="wassup">High Tension</h1>
            High Tension (French: Haute tension, French pronunciation: [ot tɑ̃sjɔ̃]; released in the United Kingdom as
            Switchblade Romance) is a 2003 French slasher film directed by Alexandre Aja, co-written with Grégory
            Levasseur, and starring Cécile de France and Maïwenn, alongside Philippe Nahon appearing in supporting
            roles. Its plot follows two female students who arrive at a secluded farmhouse to study, where they are
            shortly invaded by a serial killer.

            Associated with the New French Extremity movement, High Tension was picked up by Lions Gate Entertainment
            following a successful screening at the Midnight Madness section of the 2003 Toronto International Film
            Festival, where it was re-dubbed in English and re-edited to secure an R rating. Lions Gate then spent
            $14 million to open the film in wide release in the United States, where it eventually only grossed $3.6
            million; Lions Gate later released the original cut on Blu-ray and DVD.

                <p>"High Tension" embodies a unique blend of three distinct horror subgenres:

                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">Psychological Horror:</p>
                        High Tension is a psychological horror film that delves into the disturbed psyche of its
                        characters. It explores the profound psychological trauma experienced by the protagonists as
                        they confront a relentless and sadistic killer. The film skillfully manipulates tension and
                        fear, creating a chilling atmosphere that plays on the audience's deepest fears.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">French Extreme:</p>
                        As a part of the New French Extremity movement, High Tension fully embraces a provocative and
                        transgressive style. It pushes the boundaries of conventional horror with its intense and
                        visceral scenes, showcasing the brutal and unrelenting nature of the narrative. The film
                        reflects the movement's commitment to exploring extreme themes and emotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="pi">Splatter/Exploitation:</p>
                        High Tension can be classified as a splatter and exploitation film due to its explicit and
                        graphic portrayal of violence. The movie features intense and gory scenes that contribute to the
                        shock value, adhering to the characteristics of these subgenres. The visceral and unapologetic
                        depiction of brutality serves to disturb and engage the audience, aligning with the conventions
                        of splatter and exploitation cinema.
