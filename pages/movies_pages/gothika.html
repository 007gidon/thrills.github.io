            Gothika is a 2003 American horror film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, written by Sebastian Gutierrez,
            co-produced by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, and starring Halle Berry with Robert Downey Jr., Penélope
            Cruz, Charles S. Dutton, John Carroll Lynch, and Bernard Hill. The film follows a psychiatrist who finds
            herself incarcerated in the penitentiary in which she works, accused of brutally murdering her own husband.

            The fourth project developed by production company Dark Castle Entertainment, following 2002's Ghost Ship,
            Gothika was the second film by the company to be co-distributed by Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures, the
            first being Thirteen Ghosts. It was also the first feature by Dark Castle to boast a number of high-profile
            stars in its lead roles.

            Gothika was shot in Montreal, Quebec in the spring of 2003. It was released theatrically in the United
            States on November 21, 2003, the Friday before Thanksgiving. The film grossed $141.6 million
            internationally, though it received generally negative reviews from critics.

                    Directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, "Gothika" is a gripping psychological horror film that delves into
                    the harrowing experiences of a psychiatrist, played by Halle Berry, who finds herself imprisoned in
                    her own asylum after being accused of murder. As the narrative unfolds, the film skillfully unravels
                    the protagonist's psyche, exposing the eerie complexities of her reality and blurring the lines
                    between sanity and madness. Through its chilling exploration of supernatural occurrences and
                    psychological torment, "Gothika" offers a captivating and unsettling journey into the darker
                    recesses of the human mind. With its spine-tingling atmosphere and thought-provoking themes, the
                    film leaves a lasting impression on audiences, inviting them to ponder the fragility of perception
                    and the depths of fear within us all.
