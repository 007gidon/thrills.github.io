            Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a 2019 supernatural horror film directed by André Øvredal, based on the
            book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. The screenplay was adapted by the Hageman Brothers, from a
            screen story by Guillermo del Toro (who also produces), as well as Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. The
            film, an international co-production of the United States and Canada, stars Zoe Colletti, Michael Garza,
            Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur, Natalie Ganzhorn, Austin Abrams, Dean Norris, Gil Bellows, and Lorraine
            Toussaint.

            In 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the book series from 1212 Entertainment with the intent of
            producing it as a feature film. By January 2016 it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially
            direct the project for CBS Films. Øvredal was later set to direct the film, with del Toro, Daniel, Brown,
            and Grave being among the producers. Principal photography commenced on August 27, 2018, and ended on
            November 1, 2018, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada.

            Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was theatrically released on August 9, 2019, in the United States by
            Lionsgate Films. The film was well received by critics with praise for its depictions of the horror features
            from its source material, and went on to gross $105 million at the box office, becoming a financial success.
            A sequel is in development.
