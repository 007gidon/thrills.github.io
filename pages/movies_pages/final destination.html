            <h1 id="wassup">Final Destination</h1>
            Final Destination is a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong, with a screenplay
            written by Wong, Glen Morgan, and Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. It is the first installment
            in the Final Destination film series and stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Tony Todd. Sawa
            portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and
            several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of
            those who were meant to die on the plane.

            The film received negative reviews from critics. While it was praised for "generating a respectable amount
            of suspense", "playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing", "an unexpectedly alert
            teen-scream disaster chiller", and Sawa's performance, it was criticized as "dramatically flat" and "aimed
            at the teen dating crowd". It received the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Best Performance by a
            Younger Actor for Sawa's performance. The film's success spawned a media franchise, encompassing four
            additional installments, as well as a series of novels and comic books. The first sequel, Final Destination
            2, was released on January 31, 2003.
