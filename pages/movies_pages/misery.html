            <h1 id="wassup">Misery</h1>
            Misery is a 1990 American psychological thriller film directed by Rob Reiner, based on Stephen King's 1987
            novel of the same name, starring James Caan, Kathy Bates, Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth, and Frances
            Sternhagen. The plot centers around an author who is held captive by an obsessive fan who forces him to
            rewrite the finale to his novel series.

            The film was released in the United States on November 30, 1990, by Columbia Pictures. It received highly
            positive reviews and was a box office success. Bates' performance drew widespread praise from critics and
            won her the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 63rd Academy Awards, making Misery the only film based on
            a Stephen King novel to win an Oscar. King himself has stated that Misery is one of his top ten favorite
            film adaptations.

                    <p id="pi">Psychological Horror:</p>
                    "Misery" delves into the depths of psychological horror, offering a gripping portrayal of a
                    successful novelist, Paul Sheldon, and his unsettling encounters with his number one fan, Annie
                    Wilkes. The narrative unfolds as Paul grapples with his harrowing situation, trapped in Annie's
                    remote home and subjected to her increasingly unpredictable behavior. As Paul struggles to survive,
                    he must navigate the treacherous terrain of Annie's obsession while searching for a means of escape.
                    Through its exploration of psychological terror and the complexities of obsession, "Misery" delivers
                    a tense and haunting tale of captivity and desperation.
